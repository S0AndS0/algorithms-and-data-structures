Notes for @ThePrimeagen about Doubly Linked List

The content provided on [Frontend Masters][1] is fantastic and
translating logic to Go lang has been an enjoyable way to learn but,
smoke blowing aside, the [`getAt`][2] method can be been optimized to
reduce search time by up to one-half :-D

Happy coding y'all!
