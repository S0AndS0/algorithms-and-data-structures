## Requirements
[heading__requirements]:
  #requirements
  "&#x1F3D7; Prerequisites and/or dependencies that this project needs to function properly"


NodeJS/TypeScript development dependencies may be installed via NPM...

```Bash
cd typescript/

npm install
```

Go dependencies are, for now, minimal and only the core/standard libraries
_should_ be required.


______


## Quick Start
[heading__quick_start]:
  #quick-start
  "&#9889; Perhaps as easy as one, 2.0,..."


Clone this project...

```Bash
mkdir -vp ~/git/hub/S0AndS0

cd ~/git/hub/S0AndS0

git clone git@github.com:S0AndS0/algorithms-and-data-structures.git
```


Review language specific `README.md` file(s) for details...

```bash
vim -p "./*/README.md"
```

### Forking
[heading__forking]:
  #forking
  "&#x1F531; Tips for forking algorithms-and-data-structures"


Start making a [Fork][algorithms_and_data_structures__fork_it] of this repository to an account that you have write permissions for.


- Add remote for fork URL. The URL syntax is _`git@github.com:<NAME>/<REPO>.git`_...


```Bash
cd ~/git/hub/S0AndS0/algorithms-and-data-structures

git remote add fork git@github.com:<NAME>/algorithms-and-data-structures.git
```


- Commit your changes and push to your fork, eg. to fix an issue...


```Bash
cd ~/git/hub/S0AndS0/algorithms-and-data-structures


git commit -F- <<'EOF'
:bug: Fixes #42 Issue


**Edits**


- `<SCRIPT-NAME>` script, fixes some bug reported in issue
EOF


git push fork main
```


> Note, the `-u` option may be used to set `fork` as the default remote, eg.
> _`git push -u fork main`_ however, this will also default the `fork` remote
> for pulling from too! Meaning that pulling updates from `origin` must be done
> explicitly, eg. _`git pull origin main`_


- Then on GitHub submit a Pull Request through the Web-UI, the URL syntax is
  _`https://github.com/<NAME>/<REPO>/pull/new/<BRANCH>`_


> Note; to decrease the chances of your Pull Request needing modifications
> before being accepted, please check the
> [dot-github](https://github.com/S0AndS0/.github) repository for detailed
> contributing guidelines.
